# Sanctaury
The Jungle Friends Primate Sanctuary provides a permanent home and high-quality sanctuary care for New World primates who have been cast-off from the pet trade, retired from research, 
or confiscated by authorities. They are seeking to replace all of their paper records with computer records where they can keep track of the individual animals that are in their care. Design and implementation which satisfies the below needs is done-

The Sanctuary consists of two different types of housing:
Isolation is used to keep monkeys when they first arrive at the sanctuary and anytime they are receiving medical attention. Isolation consists of a series of cages each of which can house a single animal.
Enclosures are much larger and can host a single troop (i.e., a group) of monkeys. Each troop consists of a single species that is found in the New World (some of which are pictured below): drill, guereza, howler, mangabey, saki, spider, squirrel, and tamarin.
Enclosures are initially configured to house a particular species of monkeys but can be repurposed for a different species if they are empty.
The capacity of an enclosure is dependent upon the size of the enclosure and the size of the monkeys in the enclosure. Small monkeys (<10 cm) require 1 square meter each, medium monkeys (10 to 20 cm) require 5 square meters, and large monkeys (>20 cm) require 10 square meters.
Monkeys that are received by the sanctuary must go into isolation where they are assessed and given medical attention. At this time, each individual monkey is given a name, a species designation, a sex, a size, a weight, an approximate age, and a favorite food.
The choices of favorite food include eggs, fruits, insects, leaves, nuts, seeds, and tree sap.
Monkeys that have received medical attention may be moved to an available enclosure if there is room.
The Jungle Friends Primate Sanctuary also has exchange agreements with several other primate sanctuaries that can take healthy monkeys and often uses these agreements to find the best suitable home for monkeys it receives but cannot house.
Additionally, 

The Sanctuary should start with room for n animals in isolation and m troops of monkeys. 
While these are defined when the Sanctuary is constructed, the Sanctuary would like the flexibility of expanding should the needs and funds allow.
Report the species that are currently being housed in alphabetical order. 
The list should include where in the sanctuary each species is (both in enclosures and in isolation).
Look up where a particular species is currently housed. If none of a particular species is currently being housed, it should report this fact.
Produce a sign for a given enclosure that lists each individual monkey that is currently housed there. 
For each individual monkey, the sign should include their name, sex, and favorite food.
Produce an alphabetical list (by name) of all of the monkeys housed in the Sanctuary. This information should include where each monkey can be found.
Produce a shopping list of the favorite foods of the inhabitants of the Sanctuary. For each food listed, the quantity needed should also be listed.
Large monkeys should receive 500 gr of their favorite food while medium and small monkeys require 250 gr and 100 gr respectively.
